# Inception-of-Things
## Introduction
This project aims to deepen your knowledge by making you use K3d and K3s with
Vagrant.
You will learn how to set up a personal virtual machine with Vagrant and the
distribution of your choice. Then, you will learn how to use K3s and its Ingress.
Last but not least, you will discover K3d that will simplify your life.

## Mandatory part
This project will consist of setting up several environments under specific rules.

It is divided into three parts we have to do in the following order:

Part 1: K3s and Vagrant
Part 2: K3s and three simple applications
Part 3: K3d and Argo CD

## Bonus part
The following extra is intended to be useful: Gitlab needs to be added in the lab we did in Part 3.

☠️ This bonus is complex. The latest version available of Gitlab from the official website is expected.

We are allowed to use whatever we need to achieve this extra. For example, helm could be useful here.

Our Gitlab instance must run locally
Gitlab must be configured to make it work with our cluster
A dedicated namespace named gitlab
Everything we did in Part 3 must work with our local Gitlab
We can add everything needed so our entire cluster works.
